# Choropleth Maps

A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.

In this project, we'll create [choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) to represent the population on brazilian municipalities of Northeast Region, based on data from [IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística](https://downloads.ibge.gov.br/downloads_estatisticas.htm), using the python language with the folium library.
