# Choropleth Maps

In this project, we'll analyze population data on brazilian municipalities of Northeast Region using [choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map).

A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.

The [dataset](data/population_2017.csv) with population data comes from [IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica](https://downloads.ibge.gov.br/downloads_estatisticas.htm). We'll use python language with pandas library for data manipulation and folium library for creating maps with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).
